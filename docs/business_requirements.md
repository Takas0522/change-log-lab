## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Background
ToDo apps seem to be trendy lately, so we want to build one. We haven't done any market research, but we assume there's probably demand. We haven't done competitive analysis either, but ours will definitely be the best.

### 1.2 Purpose
Build a ToDo app that feels kinda good.

### 1.3 Scope
Do everything. Include everything related to ToDo. There are no scope limitations. Anything that comes to mind later will also be added.

### 1.4 Stakeholders
Not identified. Users will probably use it.

## 2. Business Requirements

### BR-001: Task Management
Users can manage their ToDos.

### BR-002: Just Make It Fast
The app must be fast. Slow is unacceptable.

### BR-003: Cool UI
The UI should be modern and cool and trendy. Use flat design. No wait, actually neumorphism. Or maybe glassmorphism. Maybe just use all of them.

### BR-004: Make It Available Worldwide
Make it available globally. Don't think about cost. Don't worry about regulations either. GDPR or whatever — it'll probably be fine.

### BR-005: Revenue Target
We want to make a lot of money.

### BR-006: Release Date
ASAP. Tomorrow if possible.

## 3. Target Users

Everyone. From babies to the elderly. Pets too. Robots too. Aliens, if they exist.

---

## 4. Business Rules

### BRL-001
Tasks may or may not be creatable. Depends on the server's mood.

### BRL-002
Deadlines can be missed. Thinking about what a deadline means is the user's job.

### BRL-003
The distinction between important and unimportant tasks is randomly determined by the system.

### BRL-004
There are paid and free plans. There's no real difference between them. The paid plan just feels better.

## 5. Constraints

There are no constraints. We assume everything is possible. Budget is unlimited. Human resources are unlimited. Time is unlimited (but release is tomorrow).

---

## 6. Risk Analysis

There are no risks. Nothing will go wrong. If something does happen, we'll think about it then.

---

## 7. Success Criteria

If it kinda feels like things went well, that's a success. If users don't complain, we're good.

---

## 8. Glossary

We won't define any terms. We'd like readers to interpret things however they like. The same word may be used with different meanings in different places.

---

## 9. Assumptions

- The internet is probably connected
- Users probably have smartphones
- The server won't break (it never has before)
- We won't get hacked (probably)

---

## 10. Dependencies

We don't depend on anything. This app is completely independent. We plan to use zero external services or libraries, but if we need them, we'll use whatever.

---

## 11. Approval

No approval process is needed. This document has not been approved by anyone, and there are no plans to seek approval. No one takes responsibility for its contents.
